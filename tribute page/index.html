                Sindhutai was born on November 14, 1948, in the village of “Pimpri Meghe” in the Wardha district of Maharashtra. Her father was called “Abhimaan Sathe” who was a Charava (herding animal).
                When Sindhutai was 10 years old, she was married to “Srihari Sapkal”, 30 years old. She was the mother of 3 children at the age of 20.

Sindhutai complained to the village chief’s district officer that She did not charge the villagers. To avenge their insult, Mukhiyana Srihari (Sindhutai’s husband) was instigated by the villagers to kick Sindhutai out of the house while she was 9 months pregnant.
Sindhutai has dedicated her whole life to orphans. That is why her name is “Mai” (Mother). They adopted 1050 orphans. She had 207 sons and 36 daughters-in-law in her family till today. She has over 1000 grandchildren.

Her daughter is a lawyer and many of the adopted children are doctors, engineers, lawyers and many of them also run their own orphanages. Sindhutai has received a total of 273 national and international awards, including the Maharashtra State “Ahilyabai Holkar Award” for social workers who work for women and children.

Use all that money from the orphanage price. Her orphanage is located in Pune, Wardha, Saswad (Maharashtra). In 2010 a Marathi film based on the life of Sindhutai was shot “Mee Sindhutai Sapkal”, which was shortlisted for the 54th London Film Festival. Sindhutai’s husband turned 80, he came to live with them.
